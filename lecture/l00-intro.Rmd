All materials are available freely online.   Some also have a deadtree version available for purchase.

-  [Wickham  & Grolemund “R for Data Science”](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) .small[A great tutorial to practical use of R to solve problems with data]
-  [Wickham “Advanced R”](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) .small[Once you understand the basics, and want a deeper understanding of the internals of R]
-  [Peng “R Programming for Data Science”](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming) .small[An alternative to Wickham's "Advanced R"]
-  [McBain “Git for Scientists”](https://milesmcbain.github.io/git_4_sci/) .small[use of git/github beyond the rstudio gui.  Eventually you'll need to worry about this]
-  [Wickham “R Packages”](https://r-pkgs.org/) .small[if you end up using a function in more than one project you should consider building a package.  Not quite in scope for this class.]

# Overview

R (and programming) fundamentals with a data science and statistics emphasis. Collaborative and reproducible programming.

-  Homework and labs (60%)
.small[~weekly.  Homework will be completed  independently, out-of-class.  Labs will occur in-class and may be completed in groups.]
-  Participation / Quizzes (10%)
.small[Actively attending class, completing periodic quizzes (delivered in-class) to check understanding.]
-  Take-home final (30%)
.small[An open book, no-collaboration-permitted final will be assigned on November 4, and will be due 24 hours later.]

**Then** the final credit of this class will cover SAS coding.

# Other syllabus items

## Homework and github usage

* Homework will be posted, turned-in, and graded on github classrooms.
* We will shortly discuss logistics of this and how your use of this will be a component of your grade
* I will sometimes accept a late assignments if I see progress and a consistent commit history in that assignment. If I do not see any progress in an assignment, I will not accept a late submission.

## Academic honesty and programming

1.  You may generally work together<sup>1</sup>.
2.  You may generally google it, but cite your sources and see the next item.
3.  Write your own solutions and *own code*.  **This generally means no copy-paste!**  Let's look at [the syllabus](../static/syllabus430-2024.pdf) for complete details.
4.  Exception: labs, which will be marked as such, are collaborative within each group.


### Code of conduct
Respect each other<sup>2</sup>.  The UR harassment and discrimination policy applies<sup>3</sup>.
